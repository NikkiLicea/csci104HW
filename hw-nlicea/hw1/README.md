I have had difficulty running my tests. Initially I had 83% of the tests passed but after my laptop shut down this amount went down to 61%. I don't believe it was because my code was unsaved as it looks relatively the same and when I run gdb it actually moves up my code going from line 198 to 197 in the label_tests.cpp. This was not the case beforehand so I am confused.
